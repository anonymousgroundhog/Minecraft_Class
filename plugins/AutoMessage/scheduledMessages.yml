#                        AutoMessage — scheduledMessages.yml
# ============================================================================
# This file defines all automatically dispatched messages used by AutoMessage.
# Each entry represents one scheduled announcement, which may contain multiple
# message formats such as chat, actionbar, title, bossbar, and sound notices.
#
# How it works:
#  • Messages are dispatched in a sequence, based on the selector strategy
#    configured in messagesDispatcher.yml.
#  • Each message may contain access rules (audience filters) to restrict
#    delivery to specific players (groups, permissions, etc.).
#
# Structure of a scheduled message entry:
#  name:      Unique identifier of the message.
#  notices:   One or more notices to send using Multification.
#             Supported notice types:
#               - Chat
#               - Actionbar
#               - Title / Subtitle
#               - BossBar
#               - Sound
#
#  rules:     Optional audience restrictions.
#             Supported rule types:
#               • PERMISSION  -> Only players with this permission receive the message
#               • GROUP        -> Only players in the given group receive the message
#
# Editing recommendations:
#  • You may freely add or remove message entries.
#  • MiniMessage formatting (<red>, <yellow>, <rainbow>, etc.) is fully supported.
#  • Sound format: "namespace:key SOURCE volume pitch".
#  • Duration fields support values like: 5s, 2m, 500ms.
