# ============================================================================
# This configuration file defines all user-facing messages used by AutoMessage.
# It centralizes command responses, dispatcher status messages, and reload
# notifications, allowing full customization without modifying code.
#
# Sections:
#  • liteCommandsMessages   — errors, usage prompts, and permission responses
#  • dispatcherMessages     — messages for enabling/disabling automatic dispatching
#  • reloadMessages         — messages shown during configuration reload operations
#
# Editing Tips:
#  • Colors follow MiniMessage syntax (<red>, <yellow>, <gray>, <rainbow>, etc.).
#  • Reload the plugin after editing: /automessage reload
