#                        AutoMessage — messagesDispatcher.yml
# ============================================================================
# This file controls how AutoMessage dispatches scheduled announcements.
# It defines startup timing, repeat intervals, and which message-selection
# strategy the dispatcher should use.
#
# Fields:
#  enabled:
#    Master switch controlling whether automatic message dispatching is active.
#    true  -> messages cycle automatically
#    false -> announcements are paused
#
#  period:
#    Time between consecutive dispatch executions.
#    Examples: 10s, 1m, 500ms
#
#  initialDelay:
#    How long the dispatcher should wait before sending the first message
#    after plugin startup.
#
#  selector:
#    Strategy determining which scheduled message is selected next.
#    Supported types:
#       SEQUENTIAL – cycle through messages in order
#       RANDOM     – choose a random message each time
#
# Notes:
#  • This file works together with scheduledMessages.yml.
#  • After editing this file you must restart the server, as dispatcher
#    scheduling is configured during plugin initialization.
